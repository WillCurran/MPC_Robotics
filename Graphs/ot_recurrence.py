# Goal : count actual complexity of implementation, and theoretical complexity of a
#        more efficient implementation.

# count the number of OTs by category with a recurrence based on our circuits
# also, count number of rounds of OTs necessary if we had parallelized execution
# (which we didn't, but it can be done)
